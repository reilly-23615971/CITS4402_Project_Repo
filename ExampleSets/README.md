The OldTrainingSet and OldTestingSet folders are the sets made with an older version of the createDataset function. The train_set and test_set files are compressed sets made with the latest version of the createDataset function. Both use the Daimer dataset as a base and have 200 images in the test set and 500 in the training set, but the older dataset has different file names and will likely be deleted before we submit the project. As such, you may want to get your code working with the file names of the newer dataset early, especially if it's possible to work with the zipped data directly instead of unpacking it.
